# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
This project involves transforming and analyzing data using SQL. The aim is to demonstrate ability in SQL by presenting a series of tasks that involve data extraction, transformation, and analysis. The project will be setting the ability to handle involved SQL queries, data manipulation, and generating meaningful insights from the data.
Goals:
1.	Data Extraction: Usefully extract data from one or more databases.
o	Use SQL queries to fetch data from multiple tables.
o	Utilize joins, subqueries, and common table expressions (CTEs) to retrieve the necessary data.
2.	Data Transformation: Clean and transform the data to prepare it for analysis.
o	Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.
o	Perform data normalization and standardization.
3.	Data Analysis: Analyze the transformed data to derive insights.
o	Use aggregate functions to summarize data.
o	Perform building complex calculations and derive new metrics.


## Process

### (your step 1) Donwload tables 
### (your step 2) Analisis the fields for all tables 
### (your step 3) Beging to define the table structure (Fields type and Keys)
### (your step 4) Define EDR
### (your step 5) Beging to analisis every field (Colunnus) and identify Risk, Funcionality, Incomplete, Redundance and Ambiguity 	

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
--- ambiguity between - unit_price (analytics) and product_price (all_sessions)

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
